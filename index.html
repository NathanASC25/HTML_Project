    <h1>Modern Anti-Tank Ammunition</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>Inspired by War Thunder <br><br> By Nathan Chin<br></h4>
    <h3>There are many types of anti-tank ammunition that have been developed throughout history, including but not limited to:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>APBC</li>
        <li>HEAT-FS</li>
        <li>APCBC</li>
        <li>APDS</li>
        <li>APCR or HVAP</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>However, I will only display information about the APFSDS and ATGM rounds in this document.</h3>

    <h3>APFSDS (Kinetic Round)</h3>
    <p>APFSDS, which stands for Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot,
        is a type of anti-tank ammunition <br>that is used to defeat modern tank defenses
        through high velocity and pinpoint surface area. <br>The design is simiar to that
        of an arrow. It relies on brute kinetic force rather than chemically <br> charged 
        reactions to defeat enemy armor. As of now, militaries around the world have been utilizing this <br>technology for more than 50 years&excl; Below are images of APFSDS. <br><br>Click on

    <h3>ATGM (Chemical Round)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>ATGM, which stands for Anti-Tank Guided Missile, is a type of anti-tank ammunition that is used to defeat modern <br>enemy defenses by chemically-charged means. When the projectile detects obstruction, it detonates and fires a jet <br>of high-velocity, molten metal to penetrate heavy armor. Light armored vehicles are also vulnerable to this particular <br>weapon's explosive force. The ATGM has been developed since the 1950s and 1960s&excl; Below are images of the ATGM. <br><br>Click on the image below to learn more about ATGMs.</p>
